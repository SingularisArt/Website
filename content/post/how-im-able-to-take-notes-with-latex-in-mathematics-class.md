For a **very long time**, I have been trying to create the perfect setup for
note taking in general (but more specifically, for **math**). Before, I used to
use [notion](https://notion.so) to take my notes, which was okay, but I wanted
something much more productive. And thus, my system was **BORN**!

If you want to see how my notes look like now, go
[here](https://damrah.netlify.app/notes). I also store all of my notes
[here](https://github.com/SingularisArt/notes).

I created this method after the summer finished **9th grade**. I am preparing my self
for when I go to university. So I set myself **3** goals:
* Writing mathematical equations as fast (or faster) than my professor was an
  **A MUST**.
* Drawing the figures must be as **easy**, **fast**, **simple** and must feel like I am writing them on paper.
* My notes are very easily
  **manageable** and easy to **access**.

I will eventually have a ton of posts talking about this specific subject, but
for now, I will go over **step 1 (Writing mathematical equations as fast (or faster) than my professor was an A MUST.)**

## NeoVim and LaTeX

Quickly, what is NeoVim.

NeoVim is a **fork** of Vim.
For writing my **notes**, I use NeoVim
(You can find my custom NeoVim config
[here](https://github.com/SingularisArt/Death.NeoVim).)
Later on, I will create a blog post talking about how I setup my NeoVim setup.

I literally use NeoVim for everything. I use it to write **LaTeX**, **markdown**, **actual code**. A
lot of people complain saying **"Vim is to hard to learn and it's weird"**, but
trust me, once you learn it, you can ***NEVER UN-LEARN IT***, it saves you ***HOURS OF TYPING***, and feels ***AMAZING WHEN YOU'RE IN IT***.
But, yes, it does have a steep learning curve, but after you learn it, you
will be rewarded.

Now, with that out of the way, here is what my screen looks like when I am working with LaTeX:

![code-with-latex](/posts/images/code-with-latex.png)

On the left side, I have my editor (**NeoVim**) and on the right side, I have
my pdf viewer **Zathura**.

Here is a quick list of all of my utilities:
* OS: Arch
* WM: DWM
* EDITOR: NeoVim
* PDF VIEWER: Zathura

I have a huge list of plugins that you can view
[here](https://github.com/SingularisArt/Death.NeoVim#all-of-my-plugins), but
the plugin that I use for **LaTeX** is [vimtex](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex). It provides:

* Syntax highlighting
* Auto compiling
* Renaming entire environments
* Shows you the toc (Table of Contents)

But, before I talk about how I configure NeoVim for **LaTeX**, let me explain to you how I setup my NeoVim. This won't be an in depth tutorial (that will be in a different post.)

For installing NeoVim Plugins, I use [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim), which is a plugin-manager written in **lua**. It only works in NeoVim because vim doesn't support **lua** (because **VIM SUCKS** only **NEOVIM RULES**.) So, if you are unsure, go here (I will update this when I post a blog post about my NeoVim setup, until then, **WAIT üò≠**.)

Now, back to **LaTeX**, I use a gazillion plugins, but the most powerful one for **LaTeX** users is [VIMTEX](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex). Here is how I installed it:

```lua
use { 'lervag/vimtex' } " If you use packer
```

Add that to your plugins.lua, or wherever you place your plugins.

Now, time to configure it. Add this to your init.vim or .vimrc:

```viml
let g:vimtex_view_method='zathura'
let g:tex_flavor='latex'
set conceallevel=1
```

The first line tells **VIMTEX** what pdf viewer you want to use to open your pdf. Simple.
The next line tells what kind of **LaTeX** you want to use to compile your document.
The last line tell NeoVim to configure the concealment. This is a feature that NeoVim uses to hide certain
parts of the code if your cursor isn't on it. It hides **\\[**, **\\]**, **$**. By making **\\[**, **\\]**, **$**
invisible, they aren't so distracting.

![conceallevel](/posts/gifs/conceallevel.gif)

## UltiSnippets

One of the major reasons why I'm so fast at typing when it comes to **LaTeX**,
is because of **snippets**.

A snippet is a short reusable piece of text that can be triggered by some other text.

Then, you have **snippet managers**, which manages the **snippets** that you make.
There are many snippet managers out there, but I use [UltiSnippets](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips) as my **snippet manager**.

Now, you can have certain kind of **snippets** for certain kinds of languages. For example, you might have **snippets** for python, while having different **snippets** for **LaTeX**.

You can take a look over [here](https://github.com/SingularisArt/Death.NeoVim/blob/UltiSnippets/tex.snippets) to see all of my **LaTeX snippets**, but I will be going over the most important ones in this article.

### Installing Snippets

Like before, put this in plugins.lua, or wherever you keep your plugins at:

```lua
use { 'https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips' } " If you use packer
```

After you install that, now run:

```viml
:PackerInstall  " If you use packer
```

Congrats, you have installed UltiSnippets. Now, to start us off, let's install some snippets, that we can later on configure. To do that we need to install another plugin:

```lua
use { 'https://github.com/honza/vim-snippets' }         " If you use packer
```

Next section, I will go over how to add/modify snippets yourself.

### Adding snippets

To add snippets, you first must configure UltiSnips itself. Now, add this to you're init.vim or .vimrc:

```viml
let g:UltiSnipsExpandTrigger='<tab>'
let g:UltiSnipsJumpForwardTrigger='<tab>'
let g:UltiSnipsJumpBackwardTrigger='<s-tab>'

let g:UltiSnipsEditSplit='vertical'

let g:UltiSnipsSnippetDirectories=['~/.config/nvim/UltiSnips/']
```

Let's go over these quickly. The first line is telling UltiSnips what button you want to use to expand the actual snippet. After you have expanded the snippet, you have placeholders.

On line 2-3, you are telling UltiSnips what key presses you want to use to jump back and forth between those placeholders.

The 4th line is telling UltiSnips to open the file vertically when you run `:UltiSnipsEdit`.

he last and final line tells UltiSnips where to find your snippets.

#### Creating your own snippets

Place your snippets in `~/.config/nvim/UltiSnips/` or wherever you told UltiSnips to find theme. Each language has it's own specific snippet file. For example, python snippets will be located at `~/.config/nvim/UltiSnips/python.snippets`.

Or, instead of manually creating that file, open a file with that extension. For example: `test.py`. Then, inside that file, type `:UltiSnipsEdit`. That will create the file `~/.config/nvim/UltiSnips/python.snippets` for you.

Here is a basic skeleton for a snippet:

```snippets
snippet SNIPPET NAME "SNIPPET DESCRIPTION"
...
endsnippet
```

To add placeholders, do this:

```snippets
snippet document "Creates a document"
Document Name: $1
$0
endsnippet
```

The `$1` and `$0` are where your placeholders will be. The `$0` is always the final placeholder. Now, you can create information within the placeholders like this:

```snippets
snippet document "Creates a document"
Document Name: ${1:DOCUMENT NAME}
$0
endsnippet
```

Now, the placeholder says **DOCUMENT NAME**, and when you reach that placeholder, it will be highlighted in visual mode, and you can overwrite it.

Now you know the basics, let's get into some examples.

### Sign

The code for this is probably the simplest.

![sign](/posts/gifs/sign.gif)

Here is the snippet code for it:

```snippets
snippet sign "Signature"
Yours sincerely,

Hashem A. Damrah
endsnippet
```

### Today and Date

You can also run shell commands inside snippets, but you have to use back ticks (\`\`) for that.

![today](/posts/gifs/today-date.gif)

Here is the snippet code for it:

```snippets
snippet date-time "Today's date and Current Time"
`date "+%b %d %Y %a %R`
endsnippet
```

### Environments

To insert an environment, all I have to do is type **beg**. I created this snippet in a special manner. It only triggers whenever it's the first word typed on the line. Also, you don't need to hit **TAB** because it will automatically expand for you.

You start typing out what kind of environment you want. Then, once you're done,
hit tab. That will move you into the environment.

```snippets
snippet beg "begin{} / end{}" bA
\begin{$1}
	${1:${VISUAL}}
\end{$1}
endsnippet
```

![environments](/posts/gifs/beg-environment.gif)

Now, I have a ton of different environments that I commonly use. So, I wasted even more time creating specific snippets for each environment:

![environments](/posts/gifs/all-environment.gif)

Now, sometimes you may want to surround specific text with the environment. So, what do you do? You can remove the text, create the environment, then paste. That feels **WRONG**. As you all know, us programmers are the laziest people. We spend hours trying to configure something to save us a couple of minutes. And, guess what? That's exactly what I did. I read through the documentation to learn about this (which took about 1.5 hours.)

It's called visual select tab. You highlight whatever you want, hit tab, then go ahead and activate the snippet. There you go, the code you highlighted is know surrounded with the envrionment you want! üòÆ‚Äçüí®

\end{cases}
endsnippet

endsnippet
```

The **b** means **If the trigger word is the first word on the line, and no writing comes afterword, then expand**.
The **A** means **Expand without the trigger key, just expand right after the person types the trigger word**.

### Inline and Display Math

These are my two most frequency used snippets. They are responsible for bringing me into math mode. They are `im` (Inline Math) and `dm` (Display Math).

![inline-display](/posts/gifs/inline-math.gif)

```snippets
snippet im "Inline Math" wA
$${1}$`!p
if t[2] and t[2][0] not in [',', '.', '?', '-', ' ']:
	snip.rv = ' '
else:
	snip.rv = ''
`$2
endsnippet

snippet dm "Display Math" wAb
\[ ${1:${VISUAL}} .\] $0
endsnippet
```

The **A** at the end of the snippet declaration means it will expand as soon as
you type the key (`im`, `dm`). It doesn't wait for you to hit **tab**.

The **w** at the end of the first line means that this snippet will expand at word
boundaries. So, `helloim` won't expand, but `hello im` will.

The **b** means it won't expand unless it's at the beginning and the first word on the line.
So, `hello dm` won't expand, but `dm hello` will.

### Sub and Super scripts

#### Sub Scripts

Another handy snippet are these ones, which is used for sub scripts. It changes
a1 to a_1 and a_12 to a_{12} and a_{12}3 to
a_{123}. It can also change a_{123456789}0 to a_{1234567890}.
Here, size doesn't matter!

![sub-scripts](/posts/gifs/sub-scripts.gif)

The code for these snippets use regular expressions for there trigger. The
first expands if there is a variable, followed by a number. Example **b3** ->
**b_3**. Here is the snippet code:

```snippets
snippet '([A-Za-z])(\d)' "Auto subscript" wrA
`!p snip.rv = match.group(1)`_`!p snip.rv = match.group(2)`
endsnippet
```

The second snippet checks if there is a variable, followed by an
underscore, followed by two numbers. Example b_34 -> b_{34}.
Here is the snippet code:

```snippets
snippet '([A-Za-z])_(\d\d)' "Auto subscript 2" wrA
`!p snip.rv = match.group(1)`_{`!p snip.rv = match.group(2)`}
endsnippet
```

The last and final snippet checks if there is a variable, followed by an underscore,
followed by a group of {} with numbers inside. It also checks if there is a
number in front of the closing bracket. Example b_{34}5 -> b_{345}

Here is the snippet code:

```snippets
snippet '([A-Za-z])_\{(\d+)\}(\d)' "Auto subscript 3+" wrA
`!p snip.rv = match.group(1)`_{`!p snip.rv = match.group(2) + match.group(3)`}
endsnippet
```

I also created a quick snippet that puts you in **subscript** mode:

```snippets
snippet __ "Super Script" Aw
_{$1}$0
endsnippet
```

#### Super Scripts

As for the superscripts, I use **td** -> **^{}**. However, I use some quick snippets for basic things like squaring, cubing, raising to a variable.
Here is a quick view of the snippets:

* **sq** -> **^2**
* **cb** -> **^3**
* **ss** -> **^{$1}$0**
* **rd** -> **^{($1)}$0**
* **compl** -> **^{c}**
* **invs** -> **^{-1}**

![super-scripts](/posts/gifs/super-scripts.gif)

Here are the snippets:

```snippets
snippet sq "Square" Aw
^2
endsnippet

snippet cb "Cube" Aw
^3
endsnippet

snippet ss "Super Script" Aw
^{$1}$0
endsnippet

snippet rd "to the ... power" Aw
^{($1)}$0
endsnippet

snippet compl "Complement" Aw
^{c}
endsnippet

snippet invs "inverse" Aw
^{-1}
endsnippet
```

### Fractions

These snippets, are the funniest and they give you a big satisfaction whenever you pull them off.

Here is my goal. To be able to perform snippets on these:

                                //  ->  \frac{}{}
                                3/  ->  \frac{3}{}
                            4\i^2/  ->  \frac{4\pi^2}{}
                       (1 + 2 + 3)  ->  \frac{(1 + 2 + 3)}{}
                    (1 + (2 + 3)/)  ->  (1 + \frac{(1 + 2))}{}
                    (1 + (2 + 3))/  ->  \frac{1 + (2 + 3)}{}

![fractions](/posts/gifs/fractions.gif)

Now, let's start off with something very easy. Creating a simple fraction:

```snippets
snippet // "Fraction" iA
\frac{$1}{$2}$0
endsnippet
```

The core of the second snippet is regular expressions. It's used to match expressions like:
* \pi^{2}/
* 39_{9\Theta}/
* cf_2
* etc

```snippets
snippet '((\d+)|(\d*)(\\)?([A-Za-z]+)((\^|_)(\{\d+\}|\d))*)/' "Fraction" wrA
\\frac{`!p snip.rv = match.group(1)`}{$1}$0
endsnippet
```

In the fourth case, I tried to find matching parenthesis. But, all of the work went in vain because you cannot with UltiSnips. So, I used Python :).

```snippets
priority 1000
snippet '^.*\)/' "() Fraction" wrA
`!p
stripped = match.string[:-1]
depth = 0
i = len(stripped) - 1
while True:
	if stripped[i] == ')': depth += 1
	if stripped[i] == '(': depth -= 1
	if depth == 0: break;
	i -= 1
snip.rv = stripped[0:i] + "\\frac{" + stripped[i+1:-1] + "}"
`{$1}$0
endsnippet
```

The last section that I want to show you is your selection to make your own fraction using **visual mode**.

![tab-fraction](/posts/gifs/tab-fraction.gif)

```snippets
snippet / "Fraction" iA
\\frac{${VISUAL}}{$1}$0
endsnippet
```

### Template

![template](/posts/gifs/template.gif)

```snippets
snippet template "Template"
\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{import}
\usepackage{pdfpages}
\usepackage{transparent}
\usepackage{xcolor}
$1

\newcommand{\incfig}[2][1]{%
		\def\svgwidth{#1\columnwidth}
		\import{./figures/}{###pdf_tex}
}
$2
\pdfsuppresswarningpagegroup=1

\begin{document}
		$0
\end{document}
endsnippet
```

### School lessons

I don't really use these that often because I created scripts that do a lot of work when:

* Organizing
* Changing
* Switching
* Loading
* Reloading

Between:

* Classes
* Lessons
* Lectures

You can find these scripts [here](https://github.com/SingularisArt/Singularis/tree/master/local/scripts/school), but eventually, I will create a blog post about how I made those scripts, how I use them, etc.

![school-lessons](/posts/gifs/school-lessons.gif)

```snippets
snippet les "Lesson"
\lesson{${1:LESSON NUMBER}}{`date "+%b %d %Y %a (%H:%M:%S)"`}{${3:LESSON NAME}}
$0
endsnippet

snippet lec "Lecture"
\lecture{${1:LECTURE NUMBER}}{`date "+%b %d %Y %a (%H:%M:%S)"`}{${3:LECTURE NAME}}
$0
endsnippet
```

### Correct spelling mistakes

I use this a **TON**. It's so handy because I don't have to leave insert mode, hover over the word, press **z=**, select the correct word, then go all the way back. UHHH, that was a lot of work! Also, if the word isn't corrected correctly, I can exit insert mode, press **u**, and select the correct word, and from now on, it will always be corrected to the correct one, which is the one that I chose. AMAZING!

Now, put this in your init.vim or .vimrc:

```viml
setlocal spell
set spelllang=en
inoremap <C-l> <C-g>u<Esc>[s1z=`]a<C-g>u
```
