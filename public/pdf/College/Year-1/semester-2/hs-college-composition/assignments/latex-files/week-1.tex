When I was younger, about $8 - 9$ years old, I enjoyed watching shows like
\textbf{Popular Mechanics}, \textbf{National Geographic}, \textbf{etc}. But I
regretted watching a simple video for almost $2$ years. I learned about
sinkholes, what they are, and how they're formed. I was terrified. The video
that terrified me the most was the video with a sinkhole with noise coming out.
From that day on, I imagined it was the end of times. Everyday, I would act as
if it was my last day, spend countless hours reading about sinkholes, how
they're formed. So much so, I bothered everybody to the point that they didn't
allow me to read anymore. But, that didn't stop me. I reached the point where I
couldn't sleep well. Every time I closed my eyes, I would hear babel from the
sinkholes and visually see it as if I was falling in one. Eventually, like all
kids, I grew out of the phobia.
